This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Storybook Integration

This project integrates a static Storybook build under `public/storybook`, allowing you to view the interactive component playground alongside the documentation site.

### Preparing the Storybook Build

Before running or building the documentation site, generate and update the Storybook output:

```bash
npm run docs:prepare
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/storybook](http://localhost:3000/storybook) to view the Storybook playground.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run docs:build
```
