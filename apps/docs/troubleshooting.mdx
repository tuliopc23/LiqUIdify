# Troubleshooting

## Styles not applied
- Ensure `import "liquidify/styles"` is loaded once at app root
- Check that your bundler is configured for CSS sideEffects (default for the package)

## Tree-shaking not working
- Import specific components from `liquidify` entry
- Avoid `import * as Liquid from 'liquidify'`
- Inspect your build with a bundle analyzer

## Dark mode not toggling
- Wrap your app with `GlassUIProvider`
- Use `useTheme()` to toggle between `light` and `dark`

## Focus lost inside dialogs
- Wrap modal content with `GlassFocusTrap`

## TypeScript errors
- Ensure youâ€™re using a fairly recent TS version
- Do not import from internal `src/` paths

## Backdrop blur looks harsh or slow
- Lower blur value or use smaller intensity preset
- Prefer GPU-friendly transforms; see Performance guide

## Missing components at runtime
- Verify you are on the latest version
- Check the API Reference for the exact export names
