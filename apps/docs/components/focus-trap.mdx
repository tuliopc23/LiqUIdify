description: Keep keyboard focus within a component for modal/dialog patterns.
---

Overview
The Focus Trap component confines keyboard focus within its children, useful for modals, drawers, and other overlays.

Import
```ts
import { GlassFocusTrap } from '@liquidify/components'
```

Usage
```tsx
<GlassFocusTrap active>
  <div role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
    <button>First</button>
    <button>Middle</button>
    <button>Last</button>
  </div>
</GlassFocusTrap>
```

Props
- active: boolean — enable/disable trapping (default: true)
- initialFocusRef?: React.RefObject<HTMLElement> — element to receive initial focus
- restoreFocus?: boolean — return focus to trigger on unmount (default: true)

Accessibility
- Use aria-modal and appropriate roles on the trapped region (e.g., role="dialog").
- Ensure a clear keyboard path to all interactive children.
