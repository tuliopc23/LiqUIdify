title: Overview
description: Testing strategy, tooling, and expectations for LiqUIdify.
---

Welcome to the LiqUIdify testing docs. This section explains how we test components, hooks, and utilities using Vitest, React Testing Library, and jsdom.

Goals
- Confidence: Prevent regressions across components and variants
- Maintainability: Clean, readable tests colocated with source
- Speed: Fast local runs and CI-friendly reporting
- Coverage: Minimum 80% lines/branches/functions/statements per lib

Tooling
- Test runner: Vitest (jsdom environment)
- DOM utilities: React Testing Library + @testing-library/user-event
- Accessibility checks: Axe (planned) and RTL patterns
- Mocking: Vitest vi.mock, custom DOM API shims in setup

Structure
- Tests live next to source: libs/components/src/**/name.test.tsx
- Shared test setup: libs/components/src/test/setup.ts
- Global setup: libs/components/src/test/global-setup.ts
- Utilities: libs/components/src/test/test-utils.tsx

Quick start
- Run all tests: npx vitest --run
- Run a single file: npx vitest path/to/file.test.tsx --run
- Watch mode: npx vitest
- With coverage: npx vitest --coverage

What to test
- Components: rendering, variants, sizes, states, events, a11y attributes
- Hooks: state transitions, SSR-safety, edge cases
- Utils: pure logic, guards, DOM-safe utilities

Non-goals
- Snapshotting complex DOM trees
- Testing implementation details (class names can be asserted if public API)
