title: Writing tests
---

This guide outlines conventions and patterns for writing tests in LiqUIdify.

Conventions
- Co-locate tests with components/hooks/utils
- Prefer user-facing queries: getByRole, getByLabelText, getByText
- Avoid test IDs unless necessary for non-semantic elements
- One behavior focus per test; group by describe blocks

Component tests
- Render with custom utilities when providers are needed
- Assert roles/labels/attributes; avoid brittle snapshots
- Cover variants, sizes, disabled/loading, keyboard/mouse interactions

Hooks tests
- Test SSR-safe behavior (no window/document usage on import)
- Verify state transitions and cleanup

Utilities tests
- Pure functions: input/output
- DOM utilities: run under jsdom and mock required APIs

Examples
- See glass-button-refactored/glass-button.test.tsx for a comprehensive pattern

Async interactions
- Use userEvent for clicks, type, keyboard
- Await screen.findBy... for async UI

Accessibility
- Prefer role/name checks (getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }))
- Add aria-* attribute assertions when applicable

Performance
- Keep tests minimal; mock heavy modules (framer-motion, icons)
- Avoid real timers unless necessary; use fake timers if needed
