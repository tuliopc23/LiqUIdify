# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate from 1.2.x and earlier.

## Package Entry

- ✅ Use ``
- ❌ Avoid importing deep internal paths or `src/`

## Renamed/Refactored Components

- `glass-button` → `glass-button-refactored` (exported as `GlassButton`)
- `glass-card` → `glass-card-refactored` (exported as `GlassCard`)

Most prop names remain compatible; check your editor types and the API Reference page.

## Provider Consolidation

Prefer `GlassUIProvider` at the app root to configure:

- theme (light/dark)
- liquid glass (intensity, blur, saturation)
- haptics (vibration/audio/visual)

## CSS Imports

Import global CSS once:

```tsx
import "liquidify/styles";
```

If you previously imported multiple CSS files, you can consolidate to the single entry.

## Tree‑shaking

Ensure your bundler is configured for ESM and does not disable tree‑shaking. Avoid wildcard imports.

## Testing & Visual Diffs

If you rely on visual diffs (Chromatic/Storybook), re‑baseline after upgrading due to subtle polish improvements.

## Need Help

Open an issue with specifics, including before/after code snippets and your bundler config.
