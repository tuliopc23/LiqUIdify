## Does this work with Next/Vite/CRA

Yes. Prefer Vite/Next for best DX.

## How do I tree-shake

Import components directly or use bundles. ESM only. Example:

```tsx
import { GlassButton } from "@liquidify/components";
```

## How do I add a new theme

Override CSS variables or Tailwind tokens. See Theming guide.

## Can I use without Tailwind

Yes. Components provide base CSS. Tailwind is optional for utilities.
