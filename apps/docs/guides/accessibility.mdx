# Accessibility

LiqUIdify aims for WCAG 2.1 AA alignment. Components ship with sensible roles, labels, and keyboard focus management. This guide summarizes patterns and responsibilities.

## Provider & Live Regions

`GlassUIProvider` orchestrates accessible helpers like live regions and haptics. Use `GlassToast`, `GlassErrorBoundary`, and `GlassFocusTrap` to improve feedback and focus containment.

## Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive components are tab-focusable
- Arrow key navigation for menus, lists, and radio groups
- Focus trap for modals/drawers via `GlassFocusTrap`

```tsx
import { GlassModal, GlassFocusTrap } from "liquidify";
```

## Labels & Descriptions

Use `GlassFormField` to bind labels, descriptions, and errors to inputs.

```tsx
<GlassFormField
  label="Email"
  description="We’ll never share your email."
  error={error}
>
  <GlassInput type="email" />
</GlassFormField>
```

## Color Contrast

- Prefer semantic tokens; they’re tuned for contrast
- Check custom brand overrides with a contrast checker (≥ 4.5:1 for body text)
- Provide visible focus outlines (don’t remove focus ring)

## Reduced Motion

Respect user preferences. Animate properties that are GPU friendly and provide a reduced-motion path.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .liquid-glass-interactive {
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

## ARIA Patterns

- Dialogs: `role="dialog"`, labelled by a heading, close button reachable
- Tabs: roving tab index, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`
- Tooltips: describe only, not essential information

Use the library primitives which encapsulate these details where possible.

## Error Boundaries

Wrap risky areas with `GlassErrorBoundary` to fail gracefully.

```tsx
import { GlassErrorBoundary } from "liquidify";

<GlassErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong.</p>}>
  <DangerousArea />
</GlassErrorBoundary>;
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Interactive targets ≥ 44px
- [ ] Keyboard only flows
- [ ] Visible focus states
- [ ] Announce critical changes via toasts/live regions
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast
