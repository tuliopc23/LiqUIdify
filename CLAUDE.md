# Project Memories

- Refactoring: Major code restructuring to improve project architecture and maintainability
- Discussed adding a memory to the project memory file during this conversation
- Created stories for 3 more components (GlassTable, GlassChart, GlassDrawer). Now have 25 components with stories, with 23 more to go
- Created comprehensive Storybook stories for 5 additional components: GlassPagination, GlassSearch, GlassFileUpload, GlassSkeleton, and GlassNumberInput. Now have 30 components with stories, with 18 more to go. Each story includes variants, states, accessibility showcases, real-world examples, and theme demonstrations following the established LiqUIdify design patterns.
- **COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive Storybook stories for the final 3 missing components: GlassFormField, GlassLoading, and GlassPlayground. Now have **52/52 components with complete stories** - achieved 100% Storybook coverage! All stories follow the gold standard pattern with comprehensive documentation including variants, states, accessibility showcases, real-world examples, interactive demos, theme demonstrations, and performance considerations. The LiqUIdify design system now has complete documentation coverage with consistent glassmorphism design patterns, CSS techniques using backdrop-blur effects, and comprehensive accessibility support.
- Checkpoint from here, also we enabled nx to handle the build
