# Repository Transition Plans for LiqUIdify

## Overview
We are undergoing a strategic reorganization of the LiqUIdify project to streamline its focus and improve maintainability. This document outlines the key changes and future direction for this repository.

## Current Changes
- **Removing related projects**: All non-core projects (such as applications, documentation sites, and auxiliary tools) will be extracted and moved to separate dedicated repositories. This includes apps, storybook instances, and any standalone demos.
- **Focused scope**: This repository will henceforth contain only the core library components. No longer a monorepo for multiple purposes, it will be exclusively for the Liquid Glass design system library.

## Library Identity
LiqUIdify is an **opinionated library** that leverages:
- **Apple Design Language**: Authentic implementation of Apple's Liquid Glass aesthetic
- **Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)**: Strict adherence to Apple's accessibility and interaction standards
- **Liquid Glass Design Language**: Embracing the modern, translucent, and fluid visual paradigm introduced by Apple

This library provides a cohesive, production-ready set of React components that embody Apple's design philosophy while ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and optimal developer experience.

## Publishing Strategy
- **NPM Publication**: The library will be published to NPM using Bun's native publishing tools (`bun pm pack` for packaging and `bun pm publish` for release)
- **Version Management**: New versions will follow semantic versioning with focus on stability and backward compatibility where possible

## New Package Creation
To better serve different integration needs and future-proof the ecosystem, we will create an additional package:
- **Package Name**: `liquidify-react`
- **Initial Version**: 0.2.0 or 0.5.0 (to be determined based on feature completeness)
- **Purpose**: This will serve as a complementary or alternative package, potentially focused on specific React integration patterns or extended functionality

## Legacy Maintenance Policy
- **Primary Focus**: We will not actively maintain legacy versions beyond critical security fixes
- **Exception**: Legacy versions may be maintained only if we can safely bump them down to a lower major version number (e.g., 0.x.x) to clearly indicate deprecated status without breaking existing integrations
- **Migration Path**: Users of legacy versions will be encouraged to upgrade to the latest version through clear migration guides and deprecation notices

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Immediate**: Begin extraction of non-core projects to separate repositories
2. **Short-term**: Complete repository restructuring and update CI/CD pipelines
3. **Medium-term**: Publish initial version of the focused library and liquidify-react package
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain strict adherence to Apple design principles and accessibility standards

## Benefits of This Transition
- **Improved Focus**: Cleaner codebase dedicated to the core library functionality
- **Better Maintainability**: Simplified repository structure reduces complexity
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clearer separation of concerns and dependencies
- **Scalability**: Easier to extend the ecosystem with dedicated repositories for specific purposes

This transition represents our commitment to delivering a world-class, opinionated React component library that fully embodies Apple's Liquid Glass design language while maintaining the highest standards of accessibility and performance.



## Project Goals
- **Complete Ark UI Integration**: Ensure all Ark UI components are properly styled and fully integrated with our design system
- **Liquid Glass Aesthetics**: Leverage Panda CSS to apply authentic Apple Liquid Glass styling across all components
- **Visual Consistency**: Implement consistent rounded corners (16px standard), typography, and visual effects (backdrop blur, smooth transitions) throughout the library
- **Component Parity**: Maintain feature completeness while enhancing the visual design to match Apple's HIG guidelines
- **Developer Experience**: Provide seamless styling that works out-of-the-box with minimal customization needed
