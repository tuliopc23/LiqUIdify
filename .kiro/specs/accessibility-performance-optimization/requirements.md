# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform LiquidUI from its current B-grade status to an S-tier production-ready component library by addressing critical accessibility gaps, performance bottlenecks, and production readiness issues. This feature focuses on the foundational improvements needed to achieve 95%+ Lighthouse accessibility scores, <30KB core bundle size, and zero runtime errors while maintaining the library's unique Apple Liquid Glass design language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Accessibility Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer building accessible applications, I want LiquidUI components to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards out of the box, so that I can confidently use them in production without accessibility concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any LiquidUI component is rendered THEN it SHALL achieve a minimum 95% Lighthouse accessibility score
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboard only THEN all interactive components SHALL be fully accessible via keyboard navigation
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN all components SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels, roles, and live region announcements
4. WHEN color contrast is measured THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
5. WHEN focus moves between components THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible and follow logical tab order
6. WHEN dynamic content changes THEN screen readers SHALL be notified through appropriate live regions

### Requirement 2: Performance and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer concerned about application performance, I want LiquidUI to have minimal impact on bundle size and runtime performance, so that my applications remain fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the core LiquidUI bundle is analyzed THEN it SHALL be less than 30KB gzipped
2. WHEN optional features like animations are used THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded and tree-shakeable
3. WHEN components render THEN Time to Interactive (TTI) SHALL improve by at least 100ms compared to current implementation
4. WHEN animations run THEN they SHALL maintain 60fps performance on mid-range devices
5. WHEN CSS is analyzed THEN unused styles SHALL be automatically removed in production builds
6. WHEN components are imported individually THEN only required dependencies SHALL be included in the bundle

### Requirement 3: Production Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer deploying LiquidUI in production, I want robust error handling and graceful degradation, so that component failures don't break the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN it SHALL display a fallback UI instead of crashing
2. WHEN animations fail to load THEN components SHALL gracefully degrade to static versions
3. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN core functionality SHALL remain accessible through progressive enhancement
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN components SHALL handle errors gracefully with retry mechanisms
5. WHEN SSR hydration occurs THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatches or console errors
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer integrating LiquidUI, I want excellent TypeScript support, comprehensive documentation, and helpful development tools, so that I can implement components efficiently and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using TypeScript THEN all components SHALL have complete type definitions with branded types and generics
2. WHEN developing locally THEN a DevTools component SHALL provide performance monitoring and accessibility checking
3. WHEN viewing documentation THEN interactive code examples SHALL be available for all components
4. WHEN component props are invalid THEN helpful error messages SHALL guide developers to correct usage
5. WHEN migrating between versions THEN clear migration guides SHALL be provided
6. WHEN debugging issues THEN comprehensive logging and debugging tools SHALL be available in development mode

### Requirement 5: Advanced Animation and Physics System

**User Story:** As a designer and developer, I want sophisticated animation capabilities that reflect Apple's Liquid Glass design language, so that I can create premium user experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are triggered THEN they SHALL follow Apple's Liquid Glass physics principles with realistic motion
2. WHEN multiple animations occur THEN they SHALL be choreographed and synchronized appropriately
3. WHEN users have reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL respect accessibility settings
4. WHEN gestures are performed THEN components SHALL respond with appropriate haptic-like feedback animations
5. WHEN animations are customized THEN a comprehensive API SHALL allow fine-tuned control over timing and easing
6. WHEN performance is critical THEN animations SHALL be optimized to avoid layout thrashing and reflows

### Requirement 6: World-Class Visual Design and Polish

**User Story:** As a designer and developer creating premium applications, I want LiquidUI components to be visually stunning and follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines perfectly, so that my applications can impress users and stand out in the market.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are displayed THEN they SHALL follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines with pixel-perfect precision
2. WHEN interactions occur THEN visual feedback SHALL be immediate, smooth, and delightful with industry-leading polish
3. WHEN components are viewed THEN the Liquid Glass aesthetic SHALL be authentic and visually impressive
4. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL feel natural and physics-based, matching Apple's design language
5. WHEN components are compared to industry leaders THEN they SHALL exceed the visual quality of Material-UI, Ant Design, and Chakra UI
6. WHEN designers evaluate the library THEN they SHALL be impressed by the attention to detail and visual craftsmanship

### Requirement 7: Legacy Code Cleanup and Modernization

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the LiquidUI codebase, I want to remove legacy code and failed migrations, so that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and follows modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN all legacy code patterns SHALL be identified and documented for removal
2. WHEN failed migrations are found THEN they SHALL be either completed properly or rolled back cleanly
3. WHEN duplicate implementations exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into single, well-tested implementations
4. WHEN outdated dependencies are detected THEN they SHALL be updated or replaced with modern alternatives
5. WHEN code quality is measured THEN technical debt SHALL be reduced by at least 80%
6. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the codebase SHALL follow consistent patterns and modern React best practices
