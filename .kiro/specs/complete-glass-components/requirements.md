# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Complete the implementation of the remaining glass components for the LiqUIdify component library. The library is a production-ready React component library with glassmorphism design and physics-based interactions, featuring 52+ components with TypeScript-first development, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), and modular architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using LiqUIdify, I want access to all 19 remaining glass components, so that I can build complete applications with consistent glassmorphism design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import any of the 19 remaining glass components THEN the component SHALL be available and properly typed
2. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL follow the established glassmorphism design patterns
3. WHEN I interact with form components THEN they SHALL provide proper validation states and accessibility features
4. WHEN I use navigation components THEN they SHALL support keyboard navigation and screen readers
5. WHEN I use feedback components THEN they SHALL provide appropriate visual and auditory feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to follow consistent API patterns, so that I can easily learn and use the entire component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL support size variants (sm, md, lg)
2. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL support variant props for different visual styles
3. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL accept standard HTML attributes via props spreading
4. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL be forwardRef compatible for ref access
5. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces exported

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to be accessible, so that my applications work for users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use form components THEN they SHALL include proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN I use interactive components THEN they SHALL support keyboard navigation
3. WHEN I use components with state changes THEN they SHALL announce changes to screen readers
4. WHEN I use components with focus THEN they SHALL have visible focus indicators
5. WHEN I use complex components THEN they SHALL follow WAI-ARIA patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to have consistent styling and animations, so that my application has a cohesive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use any glass component THEN it SHALL use the established glassmorphism visual effects
2. WHEN I interact with components THEN they SHALL have smooth physics-based animations
3. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide appropriate hover states
4. WHEN components change state THEN they SHALL animate transitions smoothly
5. WHEN I use components in different themes THEN they SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to be performant and tree-shakeable, so that my application bundle size remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import individual components THEN only the required code SHALL be included in my bundle
2. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL not cause unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN components use animations THEN they SHALL be hardware-accelerated where possible
4. WHEN components handle large datasets THEN they SHALL implement virtualization or pagination
5. WHEN components are not visible THEN they SHALL not perform expensive operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive component exports, so that I can import components using the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import from the main package THEN all components SHALL be available
2. WHEN I import individual components THEN they SHALL be available via subpath exports
3. WHEN I import component bundles THEN related components SHALL be grouped appropriately
4. WHEN I import components THEN TypeScript SHALL provide full type information
5. WHEN I build my application THEN all imports SHALL resolve correctly
