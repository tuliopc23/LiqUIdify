# Accessibility
## Core expectations
Ship accessible interactions by default, and verify in your app context.

### Keyboard
- All interactive components should be keyboard operable
- Keep visible focus outlines

### Screen readers
- Provide labels and roles where needed
- Prefer semantic HTML in composition

### Motion
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Provide non-animated fallbacks for essential interactions
