# Performance
## Keep bundles small
Compose imports and styles to minimize what ships to the client.

### Subpath imports
Import only what you use.

```ts
import { Tabs } from "liquidify-react/tabs"
```

### CSS
Import the library CSS once at the app root.

```ts
import "liquidify-react/styles"
```

### Server rendering
- Avoid client-only code in shared modules
- Gate browser APIs behind effects or guards
