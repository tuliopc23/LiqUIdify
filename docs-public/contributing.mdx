# Contributing
## How to get involved
Follow a lightweight workflow focused on clarity and quality.

### Code of Conduct
Be respectful. Provide context. Prefer small, focused changes.

### Issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one
- Include reproduction steps and environment details

### Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Update or add docs under docs-public/ when you change APIs
- Run checks locally:

```bash
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run test
```

### Docs changes only
- Add or update MDX files under docs-public/
- Do not modify library source to author docs
- For component docs, prefer subpath imports and short guidance
