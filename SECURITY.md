# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Thank you for helping keep LiqUIdify and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest minor release and security patches for the previous minor when applicable. If you encounter a vulnerability on an older version, please try to reproduce on the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security concerns. Instead:

1. Email: security@liquidify.dev (or maintainers’ contact listed on npm) with:
   - Description of the issue and potential impact
   - A minimal reproduction if possible
   - Affected versions and environment
2. Alternatively, use GitHub Security Advisories to privately report the issue if available.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work with you on a fix and coordinated disclosure.

## Disclosure Policy

- We prefer coordinated disclosure with a clear timeline for patch and public notice.
- Credits will be given to researchers who responsibly disclose and assist with remediation.

## Best Practices for Consumers

- Pin to a specific version range and update regularly
- Audit dependencies with your package manager’s audit tools
- Review changelogs for security-related notes

## Encryption

If you need to send sensitive details, request our PGP key in your initial email and we’ll provide it for encrypted communication.
