# STATUS.md

This document tracks progress across phases: Package (UI Library), Storybook, and Docs. It includes commands run, trimmed results, and remaining issues.

## Phase 1 — Package (UI Library)

### What I changed
- Initialized status tracking and baseline verification.
- Fixed GlassButton asChild warning by forwarding classes/props to child element without injecting Fragment content.
- Validated library builds (ESM+CJS) and types via build:lib.

### Commands run (planned/initial)
- bun --version
- bun run type-check
- bun run test
- bun run build:lib

### Results (trimmed)
- Bun version: 1.2.19
- Type-check: OK (no errors) via `bunx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json`
- Tests: suites executing clean; GlassButton warning eliminated after fix
- Build: success with Vite (rolldown) + dts; ESM and CJS outputs generated; index.d.ts emitted
- Note: Warning from package.json exports about "style" condition ordering persists; not blocking builds/tests

### Remaining issues / follow-ups
- Complete a full uninterrupted vitest run and capture full results to `.logs/vitest.initial.full.log`.
- Decide on CSS export approach (keep current and document usage of "./css" export, or adjust export map if needed).
- Proceed to Storybook dev/build verification next.
