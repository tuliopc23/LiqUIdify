# Fix Import Paths Audit

## Why
The recent path structure change from `dist/libs/components/` to `libs/components/dist/` requires a comprehensive audit to ensure all import paths, build scripts, and configuration files are correctly updated. Remaining references to the old conflicted `/components` directory structure could cause import failures, build errors, or broken functionality for end users.

## What Changes
- **Audit all configuration files** for remaining `dist/libs/components` references
- **Update all import paths** across project code to use `libs/components/dist/`
- **Verify build scripts** and publish workflows point to correct directories
- **Ensure Panda CSS integration** (tokens, recipes, layers) is properly applied in dist output
- **Remove all mentions** of the conflicted `/components` directory structure
- **Validate import resolution** to prevent user-facing errors

## Impact
- Affected specs: build-system (path resolution, CSS generation)
- Affected code: package.json, tsconfig files, build scripts, test files, documentation
- **BREAKING**: Any remaining incorrect paths will cause import failures
- Risk mitigation: Comprehensive validation and testing of all import scenarios
