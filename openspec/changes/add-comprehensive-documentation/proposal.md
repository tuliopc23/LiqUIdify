# Add Comprehensive Production Documentation

## Why
Users need complete, production-ready documentation to successfully integrate and use LiqUIdify in their projects. Current README is good but lacks:
- Detailed getting started guide for different frameworks
- Component-by-component usage examples
- Theming and customization documentation
- WWDC 2025 features guide
- Troubleshooting and migration guides

## What Changes
- Create comprehensive documentation in `/docs` folder
- Structure documentation for easy navigation and discovery
- Include practical examples for all major use cases
- Document WWDC 2025 Liquid Glass features
- Provide framework-specific integration guides (Next.js, Remix, Vite, Astro)
- Create component API reference

## Impact
- Affected specs: New `documentation` spec (to be created)
- Affected code: No code changes, documentation only
- New files: Multiple `.md` files in `/docs` folder
- Benefits: Faster user onboarding, reduced support requests, better adoption
