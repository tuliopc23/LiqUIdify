## Creating the Project Board

### Manual Setup Steps:
1. Go to Repository â†’ Projects â†’ New Project
2. Choose "Board" template
3. Name: "Liquidify Development Roadmap"
4. Add columns as specified above
5. Configure custom fields
6. Set up automation rules
7. Import issues from templates

### CLI Commands (if GitHub CLI is configured):
```bash
# Create project
gh project create --title "Liquidify Development Roadmap" --body "3-phase development roadmap for component library"

# Add fields and configure board
# (This requires manual configuration in GitHub UI)
```

## Issue Templates Integration

All issue templates are configured to automatically:
- Assign appropriate phase label based on component type
- Set milestone based on phase
- Add relevant labels (component, priority, etc.)
- Link to the project board
- Include task checklists for component development

---

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Reviews:
- Update project board status
- Review completed components  
- Adjust priorities based on community feedback
- Update roadmap timeline if needed

### Monthly Milestones:
- Phase completion reviews
- Community feedback integration
- Performance and accessibility audits
- Documentation updates
